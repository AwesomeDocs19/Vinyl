During this session, I created a mug for a company called Pextra. I had to copyu the logo on the sofware and trqace everything and separate the words from the backround so the vinyl cutter can cut the vinyl. I had to use 2 seperate colors when cutting the gvinyland layer them on top of each other. I had to do this many times because the machine kept messing up or the weeding after the cutting would get messed up. I had to adjust the blade many times as thisis new vinyl and is thicker than the last one I used. I heated the mug and put it in the freezer and created the mug.
